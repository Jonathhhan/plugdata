// This file contains a set of helper functions that ofelia can use to make sure it draws on the message thread
// macOS (and possibly other OS?) require that drawing is done from the message thread
// It's also generally good to send all your window management function from the same thread
// With ofelia in pd-vanilla, it's okay because Pd only has one thread (the GUI runs in a separate process)
// In plugdata though, it's a problem because our main thread is the GUI thread,
// not the audio thread where we run Pd.

// So what we did, is wrap all the calls to Lua inside a MessageManager::callAsync
// Since these will be dequeued in order, there shouldn't be any problems with that
// But whenever ofelia wants to touch pd's variables, we also have to lock the audio thread so that we can safely interact with Pd
// On top of that, not every case can be done asynchronously, for example, if we need to return values.
// So if async is not an option, make sure to use the ofelia_lock/unlock function at least
